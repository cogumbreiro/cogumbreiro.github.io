Tiago is a postdoc at [Rice University], working with [Vivek Sarkar].
He is excited by concurrency theory and parallel programming. In
his Ph.D. thesis, entitled [Programming Multicores Safely], Tiago
proposed two techniques to handle barrier deadlocks: a deadlock-free
programming interface, and a runtime verification tool, called
[Armus]. Recently, he has been interested in using [Coq] and [Why3] to
produce certified algorithms.

Past experience, includes being a research assistant at [Imperial
College London], where he was supervised by [Nobuko Yoshida], and a
visiting scholar at [Rice University], where he was supervised by
[Vivek Sarkar]. Tiago received his Ph.D., March '15, at [ULisboa],
where he was advised by [Francisco Martins], and his B.Sc. at
[Universidade dos Açores].
