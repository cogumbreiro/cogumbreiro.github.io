# Tiago Cogumbreiro's scholar web page

Feel free to branch and alter this website.

* website: http://cogumbreiro.github.io/
* source code: https://github.com/cogumbreiro/cogumbreiro.github.io

This website is ready to be used by [GitHub.Pages](http://pages.github.com/),
but some of its content must be generated before commiting. See the workflow for more info. This way you can edit its content from anywhere in the world just using
[Prose](http://prose.io/)!


# Workflow

* alter a page: `git commit`; `git push`
* alter the publications (in bibtex): `make`; `git commit`; `git push`
* alter the stylesheets (in LESS): `make`; `git commit`; `git push`
* alter the JavaScript code: `make`; `git commit`; `git push`

# Configuration

This website uses the awesome Jekyll theme
[Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes). Most documentation about the configuration of this website is
[available there](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/theme-setup/).

I've added support for the generation a publications page from a bibtex file.
* the bibtex database is located in `_bibliography/publications.bib`.
* the bibtex2html style is located in `_bibliography/style.bst`.

Theme configuration is split into two parts:

* HTML structure is in `_layouts` and `_includes` (see Jekyll docs).
* The CSS is *generated* from LESS sources; the outcome is
  `assets/css/ie.min.css` and `assets/css/main.min.css`.
* The LESS source code is in `_less`.
* The JS source code in `_js` is *merged*  into
  `assets/js/scripts.min.js` (this is what is used).

# Dependencies

* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com): to display the content
* [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/): to generate any content unsupported by Jekyll.
* [bibtex2html](https://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/bibtex2html/): to generate the publication list.
* [Python](http://www.python.org/): used to process the HTML generated by bibtex2html.
* [less](http://lesscss.org/): to generate CSS from LESS. Ubuntu package `node-less`. *Only needed if you change the CSS.*
* [uglifyjs](http://lesscss.org/): to merge JS. Ubuntu package `node-uglify`. *Only needed if you change the JS.* When this file is not found, we use `cat` instead.
