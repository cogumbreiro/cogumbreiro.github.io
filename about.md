[Rice University], during the year of 2012.

## Affiliations

These are my roles:
    
 * PhD student advised by [Francisco Martins]
 * researcher at the [LaSIGE] resarch unit, in particular a member of
   the [GLOSS] resarch team.

## Projects
    
Current:
  
  * MACAW - Macroprogramming for Wireless Sensor Networks.
    PTDC/EIA-EIA/115730/2009 (from March 2011 to February 2014)

Past:

  *	[Callas], Calculi and Languages for Sensor Networks,
	PTDC/EIA/71462/2006. From January 2008 to April 2011.

## Tools

  * [MIL], a multithreaded typed assembly language. Developed a compiler
    from the pi-calculus into MIL (Master's thesis). Extended
    the typechecker and the interpreter of MIL.
  * [Callas], a language for programming wireless sensor networks. Developed
    the compiler from Callas into Callas bytecode. Implemented the Callas
    bytecode interpreter with support for SunSPOT.
